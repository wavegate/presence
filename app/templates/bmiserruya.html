<h4 style="margin-top:40px">Introduction</h4>
<p><b>Brain-machine interfaces (BMI)</b> is the general principle which guides the development of devices that can diagnose and treat neurological disorders, based on the past century of neuroscience research, which has demonstrated that neural function can be <b>recorded, computationally modeled, and ultimately manipulated.</b> Important precedents for BMIs are cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators which have proved tremendously successful. The father of BMI may very well be <a href="{{ url_for('main.penfield') }}">Penfield</a>, who first used electrical stimulation of the brain to guide surgery.</p>

<h4>Important Challenges in BMIs</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Partitioning</b> individual networks when most neurological systems are overlapping in the brain.</li>
	<li><b>Stabilizing</b> a way to record in an <i>in vivo</i> environment long-term.
	<li><b>Implanting</b> devices surgically with minimal tissue damage and inflammation.</li>
	<li><b>Stimulating</b> the brain in a way that is controlled and predictable.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deep Brain Stimulation</h4>
<p><b>Deep brain stimulation (DBS)</b> is a neurosurgical procedure in which a neurostimulator sends electrical impulses through implanted electrodes to specific targets in the brain to treat movement disorders, including <b>Parkinson's disease (PD)</b>, essential tremor (ET), and dystonia. It has been approved by the FDA for ET and PD since 1997, approved for dystonia in 2003, for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in 2009, and <b>epilepsy in 2018</b>. It has been used to treat over 80,000 people worldwide and has a low side-effect profile. The most common complications, which are usually related to wound infection, skin erosion, or wire breakage, occur at around 4% per electrode over its lifespan of sometimes greater than 20 years. Current routine targets for intervention now include the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus, globus pallidus, and the mainstay of therapy, the <b>subthalamic nucleus (STN).</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, <b>the precise mechanism of DBS is poorly defined.</b> Initially, it seemed that electrical stimulation was like reversible lesioning.  This has brought up many questions about the effects of stimulation on brain tissue. Identifying optimal stimulation parameters is difficult because there are so many different possible combinations of voltage, current, pulse width, and waveform. Based on animal studies, a limit of 30 &#181;C/cm of charge density is safe. Standard Medtronic DBS electrode contacts have a surface area of 0.06 cm with an impedance of 500 &#8486;. Stimulation is normally undertaken at a voltage of 1-3.5 V and a frequency greater than 50 Hz. A setting of 130 Hz is common, achieving an average battery life of 5 years with typical current amplitude of 3 mA.
<h4>Four Hypotheses for How DBS Works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>High-frequency stimulation induces <b>cessation of spiking activity</b> in STN neurons in <i>in vitro</i> studies with rodent-model Parkinsonian animals.</li>
	<li>Chronic high-frequency stimulation of STN cell bodies leads to rapid <b>depletion of neurotransmitters</b> in the synaptic terminal. This has not been demonstrated unequivocally in vitro or in vivo, and microdialysis findings contradict this theory.</li>
	<li>High-frequency electrical stimulation of adjacent areas cause uniform inhibition of GPi neurons, suggesting that stimulation causes <b>activation of afferent inhibitory axons</b> of the GPi neurons. However, this was shown with microstimulation in primates, as opposed to macrostimulation like DBS electrodes are.</li>
	<li><b>Local field potentials</b> (summed effect of neuronal activity in a brain region generated by both local and distant populations) generated by DBS disrupts pathological beta band (12-20 Hz) synchrony by high-frequency STN stimulation.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, interpreting data about the neurophysiological effects of brain stimulation requires
answering a seemingly straightforward question:
<b>does spiking activity increase or decrease in a brain
structure that is being stimulated?</b> In general, high frequency stimulation (>50 Hz) seems to cause
clinical effects similar to those elicited by lesioning
procedures, suggesting that stimulation should decrease spiking. For STN, evidence is actually split
on this matter. Data from human in vivo microelectrode recording does suggest that spiking activity decreases with high-frequency stimulation.
However, microdialysis data suggest that stimulation actually increases glutamate output from synaptic targets of STN neurons, and animal data
suggest that globus pallidus activity may actually
increase with STN high-frequency stimulation,
consistent with an increase in STN output activity. Finally, direct recordings imply that single-unit
activity may actually increase.</p>
<h4>Network Synchrony and Disruption</h4>
<p>Human and primate data demonstrate that basal ganglia of Parkinson's patients show a beta-band oscillation of substantially greater power than normal controls, and this oscillatiion becomes more powerful and synchronous as symptoms of the disease worsen. Although there is not yet a consensus on the role of beta oscillation in pathogenesis for Parkinson's, theories based on disruption of beta synchrony are more consistent with existing data than those based on alterations in spiking activity. <b><i>It is our opinion that the stimulation of inhibitory afferents along with the disruption of beta synchrony in the basal ganglia is the mechanism of action for DBS.</b></i></p>
<h4>Brain-Machine Interfaces for Epilepsy</h4>
<p>Efforts to treat epilepsy medically over the past two decades have succeeded in improving side effects of medications but not in decreasing seizure frequency. DBS has been considered for epilepsy, and so far has mainly targeted subcortical structures. Epilepsy causes synchronization across different cortical and subcortical regions in the lower-frequency bands, especially within rather than between regions. The <b>circuit of Papez</b> has gained recent attention as a possible site of epileptic propagation. Vagal nerve stimulation also disrupts cortical EEG synchrony, but rather than preventing the propagation of an evolving seizure, it seems to reduce the onset of ictal activity.</p>
<p>The <b>anterior thalamus</b> was thought to play a role in kindling and epileptogenesis based upon imaging data showing volume loss in the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) with ongoing, poorly controlled seizure activity. The <b>SANTE trial (stimulation of the anterior thalamus in epilepsy)</b> was a randomized, controlled trial that showed a significant seizure benefit for ATN stimulation. This led to FDA approval for ATN stimulation, specifically for localized onset, secondarily generalized epilepsy. Stimulation disrupts electrographic seizure activity, which is high-amplitude and highly synchronous sub-gamma oscillatory activity. It may be the case that there is an acute benefit from ATN stimulation due to the disruption of ongoing seizure activity, and a more chronic improvement in seizure response based on interictal desyncrhonization, as with VNS. If seizure reduction exceeds the ~40% rate reported for VNS, it may become the preferred therapy for medically refractory cases not amenable to surgical resection of tissue.</p>
