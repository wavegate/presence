 <h3>Dorsal Root Ganglion</h3>

<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>The dorsal root ganglion is the first-order neuron in the somatosensory pathway, and as such, is a critical structure in sensory transduction and modulation, including pain transmission and the maintenance of persistent neuropathic pain states. They have a pseudo-unipolar structure making them able to generate pain signals, as well as can sequeester antigen-specific antibodies inducing immune-mediated hyperalgesia. After an injury, the DRG undergoes dramatic changes in phenotype and function. After a peripheral afferent nerve injury, an immune cascade is initiated that involves white cells, macrophages, T cells, glial cells, and Schwann cells in the DRG. At the site of the tissue damage, inflammatory signaling molecules such as prostaglandins, bradykinin, and nerve growth factors are released, leading to hypersensitivity of nociceptive free endings.  Inside the DRG, there is a complex cascade of immune responses, largely mediated by immune and glial cells, that dramatically modulates neural activity. The electrophysiological consequences of peripheral injury across the pain sensory system consist of overall hyperexcitability together with disinhibition. Pharmacological options include the chemical targeting of voltage-dependent calcium channels, transient receptor potential channels, neurotrophin production, potentiation of opioid transduction pathways, and excitatory glutamate receptors, ablation or modulation of the DRG via continuous thermal radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency treatments, implanted electrical neurostimulator technologies, and interventions involving the modification of DRG cellular function at the genetic level by using viral vectors and gene silencing methods. Stimulation of the DRG is as effective as spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in relieving various neuropathic pain syndromes including pain due to failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndromes, and chronic postsurgical pain.
The normal IVD is considered as an organ that is poorly innervated supplied only by sensory and sympathetic perivascular nerve fibers. In addition, most nerve fibers are found in the periphery of the AF. In degenerated IVDs, the number of nerve fibers increases. However, it is unclear whether nerve ingrowth is a consequence of the action of neurotrophic/neurotropic factors in the IVD or a side effect of the normal wound-healing events in injured IVDs. The IVD is innervated by branches of the sinuvertebral nerve, by nerves derived from the ventral rami of spinal nerves or by nerves derived from gray rami communicantes. According to the classic neurotrophic theory, neurotrophins produced in the IVD, especially nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can be retrogradely transported to the soma of sensory neurons where they potentiate nerve growth and expression of specific neurotransmitters like substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide. Interestingly, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating IVDs express receptors for these NTs. The DRG neurons that innervate the IVD also produce NTs, which can be transported anterogradely to the IVD (especially NGF) and interact with (neurotrophin receptor) NTRs expressed in the nucleus pulposus cells stimulating the production of several molecules.
With advancements in neuronal imaging, we can now image neuron excitability in large groups of neurons at the same time using GCaMP6s transgenic mice. In this study, we indirectly measured neuronal excitability in the mouse lumbar DRG after a model of chronic IVD degeneration. We then correlated these findings with behavioral assessments.</p>
<h5>Methods</h5>
<p>Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have proven useful for high spatial-temporal resolution imaging .
GP5.5 transgenic mice, made by the Genetically-Encoded Neuronal Indicator and Effector (GENIE) Project, express the green fluorescent calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, in subsets of excitatory neurons in the brain and possibly other cell types and tissues. The GCaMP6f indicator is an ultrasensitive detector of single neuronal action potentials and has fast response kinetics.

These mice can be used for imaging-based monitoring of neuronal activity in individual neurons in the brain and elsewhere. 

 Here we use an <i>ex vivo</i> preparation using a peripheral neuron-specific Advillin-GCaMP mouse line and electric field stimulation of dorsal root ganglion tissues, to assess the sensitivity of many neurons at once, capable of rapidly characterizing Ca2+ activity in hundreds of dorsal root ganglion neurons. Transgenic Advillin-CreERT2 mice were crossed with STOP-GCaMP6s mice. Mice were assigned to one of three experimental groups: naive, sham operated or lumbar disc puncture to induce IVD degeneration at age 15 weeks. Those undergoing puncture were anesthetized and a 27 gauge needle was inserted to a depth of 2 mm 10 times to puncture the IVD, with injection of 0.3 mL air each time to ensure IVD degeneration. Animals in the sham group underwent procedures for dorsolateral surgical exposure with L5-L6 IVD visualization only. Post-operative care included sustained-release buprenorphine (1mg/kg) via subQ injection lasting 72 hours. In the meantime, pre-operative and post-operative behavioral assessments including open field arena, static weight-bearing, and treadmill gait were assessed at regular intervals until post-operative week 20. Cre-positive mice received three consecutive doses of tamoxifen to induce GCaMP6s expression in Advillin expressing neurons. Three weeks following tamoxifen dosing, mice were utilized for EFS experiments. Mice were euthanized with CO and a transcardial perfusion was performed with PBS. Following a midline dorsal incision, paraspinal musculature, connective tissue, and fat were carefully removed with micro-dissection scissors to reveal the dorsal bony elements of the spine. Fine forceps were used to grasp the distal nerve root and gently remove the DRG from the neuro-foramen, and spring scissors were used to carefully cut the nerve roots proximal and distal to the DRG. Isolated DRGs were placed in the center of a recording chamber, secured by a nylon mesh, perfused with aCSF, with two platinum-iridium electrodes placed adjacent to the optical field used to deliver voltage pulses with defined characteristics using a stimulus generator. Tissues were imaged to collect GCaMP6s fluorescence upon an inverted spinning-disk confocal microscope. Time series recordings at a single imaging plane were acquired. Digital images of DRG responses were compiled into high-speed video format. Within a single frame corresponding to the period preceding EFS stimulation, manual tracing of all visible cell bodies was performed in ImageJ. Fluorescent intensity values within each cell region of interest (ROI) over time were exported and analyzed using a custom MATLAB script. A repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc was used to test for differences in percent responding cells at each voltage between trials in repeatibility experiments via Prism 8. A constrained sigmoidal fit was performed on population response data to determine a half-maximal response voltage (EV50) and area under the curve (AUC). A paired student t-test was used to compare EV50 and AUC values between trials in reproducibility experiments.</p>
